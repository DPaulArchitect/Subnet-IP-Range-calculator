Professional IP Range Calculator for Network Subnetting
I have developed a highly efficient IP range calculator designed for use in computer networking, which is particularly beneficial for subnetting in Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure. This tool is a product of my own experience and necessity; often late at night, when fatigue sets in, calculating the range of a subnet can be time-consuming and prone to errors. To save time and improve accuracy, I created this calculator to automatically determine the correct CIDR range.

Key Features:
Cross-Platform Compatibility: The calculator is embedded directly into my application, allowing access from any device, anywhere.
User-Friendly Interface: Simplifies the process of subnetting, ensuring quick and error-free calculations.
Versatile Use: Suitable for various cloud platforms, including Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure.
Benefits:

-Time-Saving: Eliminates the need for manual calculations, streamlining your workflow.

-Accuracy: Reduces the risk of errors that can occur when calculating subnet ranges manually.

-Accessibility: Can be accessed at any time, making it a convenient tool for all your networking needs.

-Technical Information:
Programming Language: The calculator is programmed in JavaScript.

-Embed
Can be embeded to any website directly as a Java file.
